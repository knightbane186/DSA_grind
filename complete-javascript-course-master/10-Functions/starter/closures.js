// // is closure is a closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a function was created, even after that execution context is gone;

// //A closure gives a function access to all variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time. 

// //A closure makes sure that a function doesn't loose connection to variables that existed at the functions birth place;
